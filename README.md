# Lossless eth lotto 

This is a relatively simple project ive been working on to learn solidity, react, ethers, hardhat, etc.

It consists of a factory contract to create lossless lotteries. for simplicity sake we will use Curve testnet contracts for 'yield' It would be cool to customize yield strategies by the lottery manager.

npx hardhat 

npx hardhat compile

deploy to goerli

Common commands 
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli

npx hardhat node --network hardhat
